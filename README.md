# Analysis-and-Detection-of-Phishing-sites

Phishing stands for a fraudulent process, where an attacker tries to obtain sensitive information from the victim. Usually, these kinds of attacks are done via emails, text messages, or websites. Phishing websites, which are nowadays on a considerable rise, have the same look as legitimate sites. However, their backend is designed to collect sensitive information that is inputted by the victim. Discovering and detecting phishing websites has recently also gained the machine learning community’s attention, which has built the models and performed classifications of phishing websites. Our project is the analysis and detection of phishing websites based on the website URL. This project includes two datasets from mendaly data for phishing websites of sizes 89,000 and 59,000 rows respectively. The URL-based analysis is performed and various factors like the number of redirections, domain lookup response time, etc. are considered for analysis. One can easily detect whether a website is a phishing website or not by just entering the URL of that website with the help of our project. The advantages of this project include: • Obtaining interesting patterns from the available data. • Information regarding which parameters play a key role in making the website a phishing website is obtained. • A machine learning model is built which predicts the URL is a phishing website or not.

The code is pretty simple and one can easily run it on their computer if there is Jupyter notebook in their system. There is a minimum requirement in order to run this code since it has a neural network. Here are the software and Hardware requirements:

Software: OS: Windows 10 Jupyter Notebook Python

Hardware: RAM: 8GB Processor: Intel i5 Graphics: 4GB

These are the requirements but you do not need to be bothered if you do not have to be bothered if your computer does not have these specifications, you can also run on a low configuration system but it just takes a little more time than usual.

Please note that this code is only the backend to the phishing website detection, in order to use this code professionally, there has to be a decent frontend GUI.

Explore and Enjoy.
